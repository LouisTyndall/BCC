Github How-To
-------------

#### Before you start, make sure to be in the root directory

1.	*git pull origin master*
	* before you start work - do this command to pull the latest stuff off the server
2.	*git add .*
	* adds the file to the latest commit
3.	*git commit -a -m "What did I do?"*
	* 'commits' the changes locally - i.e. defines what has been done as a new version
4.	*git push origin master*
	* uploads new version to server
